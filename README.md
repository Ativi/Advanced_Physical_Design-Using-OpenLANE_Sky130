# <b>OpenLane</b>
OpenLane is not a tool, it is basically a flow that comprises many opensource EDA tools which includes OpenRoad, Yosys, ABC, Fault, Qflow, Magic and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. Basic aim to have OpenLane is to have complete RTL to GDSII flow.
